# "Direct Democracy to Representative Democracy"

The server will start off as a direct democracy, allowing anyone to participate in the legislative process. The logic is that, if the server starts off small, then a representative democracy would show to be unnecessary bureaucracy (in a 10 player active server, having a 1:1 representation is  too low to warrant representative democracy).

If, however, the server proves to have 30 active players within the first week or 2 consecutive weeks of 30 active players, the direct democracy would shift into a representative democracy.

*Active player is defined as someone who has logged onto the server within a week*

**It's also possible for the representative democracy to go back to the direct democracy by:**
- Not enough candidates nominate for election
- The council fails to convene for 2 weeks
- The council votes unanimously to dissolve itself
 
**Direct democracy can go to a representative democracy via**
- The first week of the server reaching 30+ active players
- 2 consecutive weeks in a month where the server maintains 30+ active players
- By a supermajority vote of the direct democracy, with atleast 6 ayes
