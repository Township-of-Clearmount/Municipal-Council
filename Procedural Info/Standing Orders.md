(2) After an amendment has been moved, seconded, and evaluated as to its procedural acceptability, the Presiding Officer declares that the amendment is now before the Council and debate on the main motion is set aside and the amendment is debated until it has been decided, whereupon debate resumes on the main motion (as amended or not) and other amendments may be proposed.

(3) An amendment must be relevant to the motion it seeks to amend. It must not stray from the main motion but must aim to refine its meaning and intent. An amendment should take the form of a motion to:

- Leave out certain words in order to add other words,
- Leave out certain words, or
- Insert or add other words to the main motion

(4) An amendment should be so framed that, if agreed to, it will leave the main motion intelligible and internally consistent.

(5) An amendment is out of order, procedurally, if:

- It is irrelevant to the main motion (it deals with a matter foreign to the main motion, exceeds its scope, or introduces a new proposition which should properly be the subject of a separate substantive motion with notice);
- It raises a question substantially the same as one which the Council has decided in the same session or conflicts with an amendment already agreed to;

(4) The previous question, has two uses: 

- To supersede the question under debate since, if it is negatived, the Presiding Officer is bound not to put the question on the main motion and the Council proceeds to its next item of business; and
- To limit debate since, until it is decided, it precludes any amendment to the main motion.If it is adopted, it compels the Council to proceed immediately to a decision on the main motion.

(5) The previous question cannot be proposed by the mover of the main motion, nor can it be moved by a member who has been recognized on a point of order. It can be moved only by a member recognized to speak in the regular course of debate. 

(6) The previous question cannot be proposed while an amendment to the main motion is being considered but, once the amendment is disposed of by the Council  and debate resumes on the main motion itself, amended or not, the previous question can then be moved.

(7) The previous question is a debatable superseding motion which is given priority once it is proposed during debate.

(8) The same time limits applicable to speeches and questions and comments during debate on the main motion apply to the debate on the previous question. 

(9) The previous question is not amendable and can be withdrawn only by unanimous consent.

(10) After the previous question has been moved, it constitutes a new question before the Council and members may participate in debate even if they have already spoken to the main motion or to any amendment which has been disposed of.

(11) The previous question is not a substantive motion, and its mover is not granted the right to speak a second time in reply.

(12) Debate on the previous question may be superseded by a motion to adjourn the debate, a motion to adjourn the Council or a motion to proceed to the Orders of the Day.

(13) When debate on the motion for the previous question has concluded, the question is put to the Council.

(14) If the previous question is resolved in the affirmative, the Presiding Officer immediately, without further debate or amendment, puts the question on the main motion. 

(15) If the previous question is negatived, resolving that the question be not now put, the Presiding Officer must *not* put the question on the main motion at that time; the main motion having been superseded, the Council proceeds to its next item of business, and the main motion is removed from the Orders of the Day.
