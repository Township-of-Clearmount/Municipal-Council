**A By-law to Amend the Town Charter**

*Adopted 18 December 2024*

*Last revised 16 December 2024*

Whereas the law regarding the passing of bills and the requirement for the mayor to sign bills passed by Council before they are enacted as by-laws, or in the alternative, veto them and enjoin the enactment of the same has been the subject of recent discussion and no definitive solution or answer has emerged,

Therefore Council enacts as follows,

1. Section 300 of the Town Charter (B-1) is amended by striking the following from the first sentence: ", and is responsible for the passing or vetoing of ordinances passed by the Town's Council"
2. Section 405 - Enactment is added to the Town Charter (B-1), and states as follows: "A bill is enacted as a by-law and comes into force immediately after it is passed by Council, unless otherwise provided in the bill."
