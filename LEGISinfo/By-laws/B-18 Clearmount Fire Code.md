## Chapter 1: General Provisions

### 1.1 Scope
 This code establishes fire safety standards for the construction, occupancy, and operation of buildings and infrastructure within Minecraft cities to minimize fire risks and ensure public safety.

### 1.2 Purpose
 To provide guidelines for fire prevention, emergency response, and safe evacuation in Minecraft cities, considering the unique materials and hazards of the Minecraft world.

## Chapter 2: Definitions

### 2.1 Combustible Material
 Materials such as wood planks, logs, leaves, and wool that are prone to catching fire.

### 2.2 Non-Combustible Material
 Materials such as stone, cobblestone, concrete, bricks, and obsidian that resist fire spread.

### 2.3 Firebreak
 A gap or barrier made of non-combustible materials designed to stop or slow the spread of fire.

## Chapter 3: Construction Requirements

### 3.1 Material Usage
1. Buildings taller than 10 blocks must use at least 50% non-combustible materials for their exterior walls.
2. Roofs made of combustible materials must include firebreaks every 16 blocks.

### 3.2 Firebreaks
1. Firebreaks must be constructed using non-combustible materials and be at least 2 blocks wide.
2. Firebreaks are mandatory every 20 blocks in high-risk areas such as forests or villages.

## Chapter 4: Fire Safety Systems

### 4.1 Fire Extinguishers

#### 4.1.1 Water Source Accessibility

1. All cities must have publicly accessible water sources (e.g., fountains, wells, or rivers) within a 30-block radius of all structures to ensure rapid access for firefighting.
2. Water sources should be free of obstructions and protected from contamination by mobs or debris.

#### 4.1.2 Fire Extinguishers in Buildings

1. Every building must have a minimum of one fire extinguisher for every 20 blocks of floor area.
- Example: A structure measuring 40x40 blocks must include at least 4 fire extinguishers.

2. Fire extinguishers may include any of the following items:
- A chest with at least 3 water buckets.
- A dispenser pre-loaded with splash water bottles or snowballs.
- A cauldron filled with water and an accompanying bucket for refilling.

3. Placement Requirements:
- Fire extinguishers must be evenly distributed across the structure, with at least one near entrances and one near high-risk areas such as fireplaces, furnaces, or redstone contraptions.
- Fire extinguishers should be labeled using item frames, signs, or glow text for easy identification.

#### 4.1.3 Public Accessibility

1. Public areas such as marketplaces, plazas, or transportation hubs must include publicly accessible fire extinguishers every 15 blocks.
2. Fire extinguishers in public areas must meet these requirements:
- Be stored in visible and easily reachable locations, such as marked dispensers, barrels, or emergency chests.
- Contain at least one 
- Be secured against accidental activation or theft by non-city residents.

#### 4.1.4 Maintenance and Inspections

1. Fire extinguishers must be checked at least once every in-game week to ensure they remain stocked and functional.
2. City administrators should designate inspectors to ensure compliance and replenish public fire extinguishers as needed.

### 4.2 Fire Prevention Systems

Every structure must have a minimum of one fire extinguisher, stored in the proper fire extinguisher storage.

## Chapter 5: Occupancy and Risk Reduction

### 5.1 Open Flame Restrictions

1. Campfires and lava pools must be enclosed by non-combustible blocks.
2. Open flames must be placed at least 4 blocks away from any combustible material.

### 5.2 Redstone and Fireworks

Redstone devices capable of activating TNT or fireworks must include a 10-block safety perimeter of non-combustible material.

## Chapter 6: Emergency Response

### 6.1 Evacuation Routes

1. Buildings must include at least two clearly marked exit routes leading to an open, non-combustible area.
2. Exit routes must remain unobstructed by mobs, chests, or other objects.

### 6.2 Emergency Drills

Residents must conduct fire drills every month to practice safe evacuation.

## Chapter 7: Enforcement and Penalties

### 7.1 Inspection

City administrators must conduct monthly inspections to ensure compliance with this code.

### 7.2 Penalties for Fire Code Violations

#### 7.2.1 Minor Infractions

Minor infractions are low-risk violations that pose minimal fire hazards and can be quickly corrected. Examples include insufficient fire extinguishing supplies or small combustible overhangs.

**Penalty:**
- A warning issued by city administrators.
- Mandatory correction within 3 in-game days.
- Failure to comply results in a fine of 1–5 emeralds or equivalent city currency.

#### 7.2.2 Moderate Infractions

Moderate infractions are medium-risk violations that could lead to fire hazards, such as improper firebreaks, exposed lava near structures, or inadequate evacuation routes in high-occupancy buildings.

**Penalty:**
- A fine of 10–25 emeralds or equivalent.
- Immediate enforcement of corrective measures by city administrators (e.g., adding firebreaks, relocating hazardous materials).
- Temporary restriction on construction permits for 5 in-game days.

#### 7.2.3 Severe Infractions

Severe infractions are high-risk violations that threaten the safety of the entire city, such as storing TNT in combustible buildings, large-scale use of flammable materials without fireproofing, or intentionally setting fires.

**Penalty:**
- A fine of 50 emeralds or more, or forfeiture of valuable resources such as diamonds.
- Demolition of the violating structure by city administrators.
- Potential expulsion from the city or confiscation of property if the violation is deemed intentional or malicious.
